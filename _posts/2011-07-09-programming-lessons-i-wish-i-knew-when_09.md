*This is the second part of my [Programming lessons I wish I knew when I 
graduated](http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2011/07/programming-lessons-i-wish-i-knew-when.html)* 
*series in which I discuss how much I suck at programming and some of the 
lessons I've learned on the path to sucking a little less. You can read [part 
1 
here](http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2011/07/programming-lessons-i-wish-i-knew-when.html).* 


<span style="font-size: large;">**4. It's OK to be wrong** 
<blockquote>*A computer lets you make more   mistakes faster than any 
invention in   human history—with the possible   exceptions of handguns and 
tequila.* [Mitch Ratcliffe] </blockquote>School tends to be all about getting 
the right answer: tests, homework, projects, and grades are all about doing 
things "correctly". This may seem perfectly natural until you realize that 
success in the real world requires much more than just "not being wrong": you 
need creativity, risk taking, curiosity, exploration, innovation, and trial 
and error. The focus of schools on solely black and white, yes/no style 
evaluation is [killing 
creativity](http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html) 
and leaving students unprepared for the real world.

You need to be fully aware that you are not perfect. Your programs will have 
bugs, [projects will always take longer than 
expected](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law), your architecture 
will not scale, your designs are full of anti-patterns and your code will have 
to be thrown away and re-written. This is OK. Do not be paralyzed by a fear of 
error. In the world of software, you have to [move fast and break 
things](http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-innovation-highlights-2010-2). 

## Pro tip: embrace the fact that things *will* go wrong. Deal with it by 
learning to (a) be humble, (b) take ownership for your mistakes, (c) learn 
from them, and (d) do better next time. 

<span style="font-size: large;">**5. DIY** 
<div style="text-align: center;"><blockquote>*The best way to predict the 
future is to implement it.* [Alan Kay]</blockquote>For a long time, I had 
assumed that my job was to do whatever my boss told me. If I got assigned to 
work on project *X*, then that's *all* I would do. If I saw something outside 
of *X* that I thought the company should be working on, the most I'd do is 
complain about it at lunch time: "I can't believe we're using technology *foo* 
instead of *bar*!" 

Then I joined LinkedIn and I started participating in the monthly 
[hackdays](http://engineering.linkedin.com/23/linkedin-hackdays): a 
company-sanctioned way for me to work on projects that had nothing to do with 
my current "project *X"*. I loved it, won a bunch of hackdays and even got 
some of them live, such as the [Resume 
Builder](http://resume.linkedinlabs.com/). 

<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe class="youtube-player" 
frameborder="0" height="290" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/PUwEEOhcK3s" 
type="text/html" width="450"></iframe> 
<div style="font-size: x-small;">LinkedIn Hackdays are amazing 
And then something *really* interesting happened. I started taking on side 
projects on a regular basis, and not just during hackdays. I wanted to give 
LinkedIn engineers a place to talk about our work, so I created the [LinkedIn 
Engineering Blog](http://engineering.linkedin.com/); I noticed that the strict 
visibility and typing rules of Java made automated testing and mock objects 
difficult, so I added the ability to write our automated tests in 
[Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Testing+Guide); I wanted to share the fun 
of hackdays with engineers from all over the valley, so I got a team together 
and organized LinkedIn's first [public 
hackday](http://hackday2011.linkedin.com/). *None *of these projects had 
anything to do with the "primary" projects my boss told me to work on. But 
once I took the initiative to do them, I got support, praise and encouragement 
from my boss and nearly everyone else. 

## Pro tip: if you work at a half decent company, your job isn't "to do what 
your boss says." It's to apply your skills to make the company as successful 
as possible. If you see a significant problem or opportunity at work, then 
most likely other people do too. Don't wait for it to magically take care of 
itself. Go out and *just do it yourself*. You'll be amazed by what you'll 
learn, how supportive co-workers and bosses will be, and how fulfilling a job 
can be when you're working on exactly the things you're passionate about. 

<span style="font-size: large;">**6. Be heard** 
<blockquote>*Write to be understood, speak to be heard, read to grow. 
*[Lawrence Clark Powell]</blockquote>Let's try an experiment: I'm going to ask 
you two questions and all you have to do is take note of the first answer(s) 
that pop into your mind. Ready? Ok, here goes: 
1. What is the best software company in the world? 
1. Who is the best software engineer in the world? 
When you read the two questions above, a few names probably popped into your 
head. What's interesting to note about this is that *only* a few names popped 
into your head. There are *countless* software companies and engineers out 
there creating amazing software, but you inevitably think of only a small 
handful. So, you want to know *why* you think those few are the best? 

<div style="text-align: center;">Because they told you so. 
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[<img 
border="0" height="281"

width="320" />](http://thelifeinexile.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/told-ya.jpg) 
The great software companies and engineers of the world dedicate an enormous 
amount of time and effort to telling people that they are the best. This is 
done using 3 primary tools: 
1. Talking: conferences, meetups, lectures 
1. Writing: books, articles, blogs 
1. Showing the code: open source projects, code snippets, tutorials 
I'd bet that every great software company and engineer that you thought of has 
written a book (or *the *book*), *has a popular blog, has given numerous 
talks, and/or open sourced tons of code. You've probably seen their name so 
many times that it's no accident that it's the first one to pop into your head 
when you think of greatness. What will pop into your boss's mind when someone 
asks him who is the best engineer on his team? 

## Pro tip: if you want to be a great engineer, it is NOT enough to merely 
write good code. You MUST tell others about it. This holds true at all levels: 
from the guy in the cube next to you, to your boss, to the CEO of the company, 
to other programmers all over the world, the only way they will think you are 
a great programmer is if you consistently tell them you are. And the only 
effective way to do that is to use the 3 tools above: talk, write, and show 
off your code. This is the way to get recognition for your work both inside 
and outside of your company. 

<span style="font-size: large;">**It's a long journey** 
<blockquote>*"An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes that can be 
made in a very narrow field."* [Niels Bohr]</blockquote>I'm still not a very 
good programmer. I am keenly aware of many areas where I am weak; there are 
countless others where I am totally ignorant. But being aware of this means 
I'm miles ahead of where I was some 5 years ago, when I first stepped out of 
school. I still have a very long way to go. To steal a phrase from Jeff 
Atwood's delightful [Strong Opinions, Weekly 
Held](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/05/strong-opinions-weakly-held.html), 
I'm merely a "rank amateur seeking enlightenment". I hope this series of posts 
has been useful to the other amateurs out there and helps you on your own 
journey.

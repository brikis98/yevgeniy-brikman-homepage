    This talk is a very quick intro to Docker, Terraform, and Amazon's EC2 Container Service (ECS). In just 15 minutes,
    you'll see how to take two apps (a Rails frontend and a Sinatra backend), package them as Docker containers, run
    them using Amazon ECS, and to define all of the infrastructure-as-code using Terraform.

    Choosing the right people is far more important than choosing the right
    product, marketing strategy, tech stack, or coding methodology. That means
    hiring is the most important thing you do. It's also one of the hardest. In
    this talk, I describe how to hire for your startup, including finding
    co-founders, early hires, and later hires. I also discuss what to look for
    in a candidate, where to find candidates, how to interview them, and how to
    make an offer they can't refuse.

    Here's the showdown you've been waiting for: Node.js vs Play Framework.
    Both are popular open source web frameworks that are built for developer
    productivity, asynchronous I/O, and the real time web. But which one is
    easier to learn, test, deploy, debug, and scale? Should you pick Javascript
    or Scala? The Google v8 engine or the JVM? NPM or Ivy? Grunt or SBT?

     Play Framework to build complex pages out of simpler parts and how to
     stream those parts extremely quickly to the browser using a Facebook
     BigPipe-style approach.

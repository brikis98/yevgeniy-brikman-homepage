    I wrote a book! It's a "Hello, World" tutorial for building products,
    technologies, and teams in a startup environment. I based it off of my own
    experiences, as well as interviews with programmers from some of the most
    successful startups of the last decade, including Google, Facebook,
    LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, Stripe, Instagram, AdMob, Pinterest, and many
    others. If you're at all interested in startups, this book is for you.

    An open source project that brings BigPipe streaming to the Play Framework.
    It includes tools for a) splitting your pages up into small "pagelets",
    which makes it easier to maintain large websites, and b) streaming those
    pagelets down to the browser as soon as they are ready, which can
    significantly reduce page load time.

    I launched a program at LinkedIn that allows any employee to come up with an

    to life.

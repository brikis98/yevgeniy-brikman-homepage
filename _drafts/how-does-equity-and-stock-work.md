What is equity? What are stock options? What's an IPO? For most programmers at
startups, equity, and not salary, is the most important part of a job offer. 
However, coming out of college, I had no idea how equity worked and was often 
too embarrassed to ask. Searching online didn't help either, as most of the 
results made heavy use of impenetrable legal and financial jargon. As a 
result, I didn't pay attention to equity for much of my early career, and 
missed out on a lot of potential earnings. Many of the programmers I interviewed
had similar experiences:

    I was deciding between Oracle and Facebook. If Facebook hadn't offered me a 
    higher salary than Oracle, I'm not sure I would have taken the job offer, which 
    is ridiculous, because salary ended up being just a tiny percentage of the 
    overall compensation. But I didn't know what equity was. It meant nothing to 
    me; it was just an afterthought.

Below is a brief introduction to equity and why it matters. I wish I had it 
earlier in my career. I hope it helps you! 

## What is stock? 

Imagine two friends start a company. Each one wants to own 50% of the company, 
but how do they keep track of that? What they need is some sort of convenient 
mechanism that lets them track ownership of the company and how it changes 
over time as they sell parts of the company to investors or employees. For 
modern companies, that mechanism is *stock*, where each share of stock 
represents the ownership of a small fraction of the company. In the past, 
companies would print the stock information on paper, called stock 
certificates, but these days, most stock information is maintained digitally. 

For example, the two founders can decide that ownership of the company will be 
represented by 10 million shares of stock, with each founder getting 5 million 
shares. The number of shares is completely arbitrary and the founders could 
have just as easily decided to represent the company with 1000 shares or 1 
billion shares. However, you need to know the total number of shares (usually 
called *shares outstanding*) to know what percentage of the company you own. 
In our example, each founder owns 5 million shares out of 10 million shares 
outstanding, or 50% of the company. 

## How do employees get stock? 

Now imagine the two founders want to start hiring. One of the incentives they 
can offer employees is to own a part of the company. This is typically done by 
issuing new stock to give out as compensation. For example, the founders may 
create a pool of 1 million shares that they set aside for hiring. They create 
this stock out of thin air (like printing money!), but note that there are now 
11 million shares outstanding, and as each founder still has 5 million shares, 
they now own 45% of the company instead of 50%. This reduction in ownership is 
known as *dilution*. 

Existing stockholders get diluted every time the company issues new stock for 
hiring or to give out to investors. This may seem like a bad deal for the 
founders, but the bet is that hiring new people or taking on more investment 
will make the company more valuable and more than make up for the dilution. 
For example, let's say the company was valued at $500,000 before the 
co-founders start hiring, so each co-founder owns $250,000. After issuing 1 
million shares of stock for hiring, they are able to hire 5 employees, who 
help raise the value of the company up to $1 million. Due to dilution, each 
co-founder now owns a smaller percentage of the company (45% instead of 50%), 
but the smaller percentage is actually worth much more ($450,000 instead of 
$250,000). In other words, as a stockholder, it's OK to own smaller slice of 
the pie, as long as the entire pie gets bigger. 

If you get an offer from a startup, it may grant you some number of 
shares&mdash;this is your *equity*. For example, you might get an offer that 
grants you 100,000 shares. By itself, this number means nothing. You need to 
know how many shares the company has outstanding. Hopefully, this is in your 
offer. If not, ask what percentage of the company your shares represent on a 
*fully diluted basis*&mdash;this forces the company to tell you not only how 
many shares they have already given out, but also any stock they are obligated 
to give out in the future and the option pool set aside for hiring. If the 
company refuses to give you this number, it's a huge red flag, and you should 
not join. If you can, you should also ask about future fundraising and hiring
plans to try to get a sense of how much your ownership percentage may be 
diluted (see also 
[14 Crucial Questions about Stock Options](https://blog.wealthfront.com/stock-options-14-crucial-questions/)). 
In our example, you know the company has 11 million shares outstanding, so you 
would own 100,000 / 11,000,000 = 0.9% of the company.

## What is vesting? 

You usually don't get all the shares up front, but instead, they are 
distributed to you over a period of time. This is known as *vesting* and a 
typical vesting schedule lasts 4 years: you get no shares initially, then 25% 
of the shares after the first year (the *cliff*), and then the remaining 75% are 
evenly distributed over the following 36 months. The idea is to use the equity 
as an incentive to keep you at the company longer, so you can't quit on your 
second day and walk away with 100,000 shares. Typically, everyone at the 
company, including the co-founders, is subject to a vesting schedule. 

## What are stock options? 

Even as you vest, the company doesn't just hand the stock to you. Typically, 
what you're actually vesting are *stock options*, which are the right to 
purchase (AKA *exercise*) the stock at a fixed price called the *strike 
price*. The strike price represents the *Fair Market Value* (FMV) of the stock 
at the time you got your offer. Where does the FMV come from? Usually, it is 
determined by the Board of Directors based on a process known as the 409A 
valuation. 

For example, if the 409A valued the company at $1.1 million, the strike price 
would be $1,100,000 / 11,000,000 shares = $0.10 per share. After working at 
the company for 4 years, you will have vested all of your stock options, but 
you won't be able to do anything with them until you exercise them. To 
exercise all of your stock options, you'd have to pay 100,000 * $0.10 = 
$10,000. Only after exercising your shares can you actually sell them. Your 
goal, of course, is to sell them for much more than you paid. 

## How do you sell your stock? 

Initially, shares of stock are worth nothing, since you can't sell them to 
anyone (they are not *liquid*). There are 2 types of *liquidity events* (AKA 
*exits*) by which the stock becomes valuable: 

1. IPO: an *Initial Public Offering*, or IPO, is when the company sells its 
   stock to the public. IPOs help companies raise money and allow the 
   shareholders (the co-founders, employees, and investors) to sell their stock 
   to the market. 
2. Acquisition: when a company is acquired, another company buys the stock from 
   your company's shareholders (i.e., the co-founders, employees, and investors) 
   for cash, their own stock, or some mix of both. 

For example, if your company had an IPO and the stock price went to 
$1/share, you would be able to sell your shares (which you exercised for 
$10,000) for 100,000 * $1 = $100,000. Similarly, if your company was acquired, 
the acquirer may agree to pay $1/share for your stock, in which case you would 
again get $100,000 (note: as with all the calculations in this chapter, this 
is a simplification).

## How much are my stock options worth? 

Now that you understand the basics of stock, is more equity worth a pay cut? 
Well, if this is a team or product that you love enough that you'd work on it 
at any price, then the answer may be yes. If not, then there are three 
perspectives to consider. The first perspective is to compare the equity in 
your offer to similar developers and companies in your area. Wealthfront offers 
an online 
[salary and equity calculator](https://www.wealthfront.com/tools/startup-salary-equity-compensation). 
You can also consult 
[http://www.hello-startup.net/resources/equity/](http://www.hello-startup.net/resources/equity/) 
for tables that list the typical amount of equity you would get at a startup 
based on your role, seniority, and employee number.

The second perspective is to think of equity as an *investment*: the money 
you're losing by having a lower salary is an investment in the company, your 
career, and the *chance* for big returns later. You can do a little math to 
get an estimate of the potential returns and risks involved. Note that the 
calculation below is very simplified: it assumes that you exercised your stock 
as soon as it vested (for the tax benefits), but it does not take taxes into 
account (see 
[http://www.hello-startup.net/resources/equity/](http://www.hello-startup.net/resources/equity/) 
for a calculator you can use that implements this formula). 

{% highlight text %}
A = Difference between the salary in the offer and a fair market salary. 
B = Number of years you expect to work at the startup. 
C = Cost to exercise your shares. 
D = Percentage of the company you own. 
E = Investor take. 
F = Value of the company in case of a successful exit. 

Investment = (A * B) + C 
Return = D * (F - E) 
{% endhighlight %}

Let's say a startup offers you a salary of $50,000 per year, whereas the fair 
market salary for your role is $65,000. That means you're "investing" A = 
$65,000 - $50,000 = $15,000 per year in exchange for possible future returns 
from the equity. You expect to be at the company for B = 4 years, which is 
usually long enough to vest all of your stock. In your offer, you get 100,000 
shares of stock at a strike price of $0.10 per share, so to exercise all of 
your shares, you'd have to spend C = 100,000 * $0.10 = $10,000. This means you
are investing the following amount in this startup:

{% highlight text %}
A = $65,000 - $50,000 = $15,000 
B = 4 years 
C = 100,000 shares * $0.10 / share = $10,000 

Investment = ($15,000 * 4) + $10,000 = $70,000 
{% endhighlight %}

The total number of shares outstanding when you were granted stock was 11 
million, so the 100,000 shares you exercised represent 0.9% of the company. 
However, it's likely that by the time you reach an exit, your shares have been 
diluted because the company has created new option pools to hire employees or 
given stock to investors. Let's say the dilution after 4 years is 50%, so your 
100,000 shares end up representing 0.45% of the company, or D = 0.0045. 

The investor take can have a large impact on the returns you can expect from your 
shares. This is because investors usually get *preferred shares*, which means 
they get to make money off of an exit before anyone else. For example, if the 
company took $1 million in investment and had a $1 million exit, the investor 
gets their money back and everyone else gets nothing. This is called a 
*preference* and it can even be a multiple of the original investment. For 
example, if a company raised $1 million at a 2x preference and has a $3 
million exit, the investor gets $2 million and everyone else splits the 
remaining $1 million. There are other stipulations that investors can include, 
such as *participation*, that let them extract even more value from an exit 
before anyone else. Understanding all the rules and tricks is 
complicated (see 
[Term Sheet: Liquidation Preference](http://www.feld.com/archives/2005/01/term-sheet-liquidation-preference.html)
and
[Term Sheet: Protective Provisions](http://www.feld.com/archives/2005/01/term-sheet-protective-provisions.html)
for all the gory details) and you'd need to read through all of your company's 
term sheets to get an exact figure, so usually the best you can do is a 
ballpark guess. As a start, you can estimate the investor take as roughly: 

{% highlight text %}
E = money raised * preference * fudge factor 
{% endhighlight %}

When you get an offer, you need to find out how much money the company has 
raised from investors in the past and how much it plans to raise in the future 
and the preference involved (1x is typical these days). It's not always a good 
sign when a startup has raised a lot of money, as it means it will have to 
have a much bigger exit in order for everyone to be happy with their returns. 
The fudge factor is up to you, but be conservative. I generally use a fudge 
factor of 3x to account for the many tricks investors use to increase their 
take. 

How much will the company be worth if it has a successful exit? There is no 
way to know for sure, so you should try a range of values to see what your 
possible outcomes look like. You should look at the company's current 
valuation and valuations of companies in similar markets as a starting point. 
For example, if you are building a photo sharing app, perhaps you'd compare 
yourself to Flickr, which Yahoo acquired for approximately $22 million in 
2005. No data is available on how much money Flickr raised, but let's assume it 
was $1 million. 

{% highlight text %}
D = 0.0045 
E = $1,000,000 * 1x preference * 3x fudge factor = $3,000,000 
F = $22,000,000 

Investment = ($15,000 * 4) + $10,000 = $70,000 
Return = 0.0045 * ($22,000,000 - $3,000,000) = $85,500 
{% endhighlight %}

Now lets see what it looks like if your company is more like Photobucket, 
which raised $15 million in funding and was acquired by Newscorp in 2007 for 
$250 million: 

{% highlight text %}
D = 0.0045 
E = $15,000,000 * 1x preference * 3x fudge factor = $45,000,000 
F = $250,000,000 

Investment = ($15,000 * 4) + $10,000 = $70,000 
Return = 0.0045 * ($250,000,000 - $45,000,000) = $922,500
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, if you want to use an extreme example, you could look at Instagram, 
which raised $57 million and was acquired by Facebook for $1 billion in 2012: 

{% highlight text %}
D = 0.0045 
E = $57,000,000 * 1x preference * 3x fudge factor = $171,000,000 
F = $1,000,000,000 

Investment = ($15,000 * 4) + $10,000 = $70,000 
Return = 0.0045 * ($1,000,000,000 - $171,000,000) = $3,730,500 
{% endhighlight %}

For reference, the average exit for a successful venture-backed startup is 
roughly [$242 million](http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/14/crunchbase-reveals-the-average-successful-startup-raises-41m-exits-at-242-9m/). 

What are the odds that a startup succeeds? You've probably heard the scary 
statistic that 90% of startups fail. The real numbers, of course, depend on 
how you define "startup" and how you define "failure". For example, let's 
assume this is a VC backed company, which typically have a failure rate of 
[75%](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443720204578004980476429190). 
If your company was acquired for $22 million like 
Flickr, you are investing $70,000 for a chance to earn $85,500, or 1 in 4 odds 
of a 1.2x return. Ouch. However, if the company has a $250 million exit like 
Photobucket, then you are investing $70,000 for a chance to earn $922,500, or 1 
in 4 odds of a 13x return. That's a bit better. And if the company has a $1 
billion exit like Instragram, then you're investing $70,000 for a chance to 
earn $3.7 million, or 1 in 4 odds for a 53x return. Now we're 
talking! (Note: this calculation is a simplification and the odds of a huge
exit are lower than the odds of a small exit).

Is it worth it? That depends on the person. For some, a high probability of 
losing $70,000 is an unacceptable risk. For others, it's worth gambling 
$70,000 if it buys you startup experience, learning opportunities, career 
growth, new relationships, and a chance at massive returns. Startups are a 
gamble and you should only join if you have some tolerance for risk. 
This brings us to a third perspective on equity: it's a lottery ticket. It 
probably won't pay out, but if it does, it could change everything. 

<blockquote>
  <p>
    It's really comes down to an individuals personal financial situation and goals, 
    but, in my opinion, if you're a younger person and you're here in the Valley, 
    you might as well take some bets. Making $10k or $20k more in salary is 
    not going to change your life. Making a million more will. 
  </p>
  <p>
    So, if you're here, you might as well play the game. Roll the dice a couple 
    times. Go work at 3 different startups over 6 or 7 years. Try them all out, 
    learn a lot, and then settle down and go work at Google, or keep working at 
    startups if you love it. You might get a hit. You might not. If not, bad luck. 
    It's ok: you're still getting paid. Maybe you're getting paid a little less at 
    startups and you're out, say, $50k salary over 3 years. Who cares? After you 
    pay taxes, it's not going to make a dent in your savings.

When it comes to startups, many engineers will tell you that negotiating for 
salary instead of equity is a newbie mistake: 

<blockquote>
  <p>
    When interviewing at Google, I had no idea what I was doing 
    in general. I mean, I was an idiot across the board. I remember I spent all of 
    this time negotiating my salary with my recruiter and I was pushing on totally 
    the wrong things. I was like, "alright, I need 5,000 dollars more a year and 
    we're moving from Germany, so I need help with relocation." In retrospect, and 
    it was <em>quick</em> retrospect after I got there, that was the stupidest 
    negotiating tactic of all time. I should've said you can pay me nothing, 
    just give me stock.

</blockquote>

It would be fair to argue that there is hindsight bias here. If you're the 
employee of a company as successful as Google, *of course* you're going to say 
that more equity is the way to go. But most startups fail, so the equity is 
usually worthless. Is it still worth taking the chance? 

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The way I always advise people to think about it is, <em>if</em> you're 
    going to work for a company where your bet is that the 10,000 dollars of 
    salary is going to be worth more than the upside in your equity package, 
    then you're betting your valuable time and energy on the wrong company. 
    Totally the wrong bet. That is a good framing mechanism for how to think 
    about companies in general.

Startups aren't all about money, but if you don't believe the equity a company 
is offering you will amount to anything, it means that you doubt the 
company will be successful at all, and you're better off turning down the 
offer entirely.
